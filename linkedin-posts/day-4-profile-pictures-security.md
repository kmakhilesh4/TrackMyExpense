🔐 Day 4: Implementing Secure Profile Pictures in TrackMyExpense

Added profile picture functionality with a security-first approach. What seemed straightforward revealed important lessons about cloud security architecture.

---

✨ What's New

• 📸 Profile picture upload and management
• 🔒 Private S3 storage with signed URLs
• ✅ File validation (type, size, format)
• 🔄 Cross-device sync via DynamoDB
• 🛡️ Authentication-based access control

**Tech Stack:** AWS Lambda + S3 + DynamoDB + React + TypeScript

---

🔥 Key Technical Challenges

**Storage Architecture:**
Migrated from Cognito user attributes to DynamoDB for metadata storage due to null value constraints. Provides better flexibility and query capabilities.

**Security Implementation:**
Implemented private S3 bucket with signed URLs (1-hour expiry) instead of public access. Only authenticated users can access pictures through time-limited, pre-signed URLs generated by Lambda.

**Schema Alignment:**
Aligned with existing DynamoDB pattern (`UserId/EntityType`) for consistency.

🤖 AI-Assisted Development

Leveraged Kiro AI for:
• Security audit identifying 9 vulnerabilities
• CloudWatch log analysis
• AWS best practices for signed URLs
• Code review and optimization

💡 Key Learnings

1. **Security by Design** – Private storage with temporary access tokens
2. **Input Validation** – Multi-layer validation (MIME type, size, extension)
3. **Storage Strategy** – DynamoDB for metadata, S3 for binary data
4. **Architecture Consistency** – Align new features with existing models

---

📊 Security Validations

✅ File type whitelist (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
✅ 5MB size limit
✅ MIME type verification
✅ User isolation
✅ Authentication required
✅ Signed URL expiration (1 hour)
✅ Private S3 bucket
✅ Audit logging

**Architecture:**
Client → Lambda (Auth + Validation) → S3 (Private) + DynamoDB → Signed URL

---

🎯 Outcome

Built a production-ready profile picture system with enterprise-grade security, prioritizing user privacy while maintaining seamless UX across devices.
